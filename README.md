# stats
## Programming Exercise 5.1
A group of statisticians at a local college has asked you to create a set of functions that compute the median and mode of a set of numbers. Define these functions, median and mode, in a module named stats.py. Also include a function named mean, which computes the average of a set of numbers. Each function should expect a list of numbers as an argument and return a single number. Each function should return 0 if the list is empty. Include a main function that tests the three statistical functions using the following list defined in main:

userList = [3, 1, 7, 1, 4, 10]

An example of the program output is shown below:

List: [3, 1, 7, 1, 4, 10]
Mode: 1
Median: 3.5
Mean: 4.33333333333333
